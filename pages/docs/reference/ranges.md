# 区间与数列

Kotlin lets you easily create ranges of values using the [`rangeTo()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/range-to.html) function from the `kotlin.ranges` package and its operator form `..`.
Usually, `rangeTo()` is complemented by `in` or `!in` functions.



```kotlin
if (i in 1..4) {  // 等同于 1 <= i && i <= 4
    print(i)
}
```


Integral type ranges ([`IntRange`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/-int-range/index.html), [`LongRange`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/-long-range/index.html), [`CharRange`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/-char-range/index.html)) have an extra feature: they can be iterated over.
These ranges are also [progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression) of the corresponding integral types.
Such ranges are generally used for iteration in the `for` loops.



```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (i in 1..4) print(i)
//sampleEnd
}

```


To iterate numbers in reverse order, use the [`downTo`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/down-to.html) function instead of `..`.



```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (i in 4 downTo 1) print(i)
//sampleEnd
}

```


It is also possible to iterate over numbers with an arbitrary step (not necessarily 1). This is done via the [`step`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/step.html) function.



```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (i in 1..8 step 2) print(i)
    println()
    for (i in 8 downTo 1 step 2) print(i)
//sampleEnd
}

```


To iterate a number range which does not include its end element, use the [`until`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/until.html) function:



```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (i in 1 until 10) {       // i in [1, 10), 10 is excluded
        print(i)
    }
//sampleEnd
}

```


## 区间

A range defines a closed interval in the mathematical sense: it is defined by its two endpoint values which are both included in the range.
Ranges are defined for comparable types: having an order, you can define whether an arbitrary instance is in the range between two given instances.
The main operation on ranges is `contains`, which is usually used in the form of `in` and `!in` operators.

To create a range for your class, call the `rangeTo()` function on the range start value and provide the end value as an argument.
`rangeTo()` is often called in its operator form `..`.


```kotlin
class Version(val major: Int, val minor: Int): Comparable<Version> {
    override fun compareTo(other: Version): Int {
        if (this.major != other.major) {
            return this.major - other.major
        }
        return this.minor - other.minor
    }
}

fun main() {
//sampleStart
    val versionRange = Version(1, 11)..Version(1, 30)
    println(Version(0, 9) in versionRange)
    println(Version(1, 20) in versionRange)
//sampleEnd
}

```


## 数列

As shown in the examples above, the ranges of integral types, such as `Int`, `Long`, and `Char`, can be treated as [arithmetic progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression) of them.
In Kotlin, these progressions are defined by special types: [`IntProgression`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/-int-progression/index.html), [`LongProgression`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/-long-progression/index.html), and [`CharProgression`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/-char-progression/index.html).

Progressions have three essential properties: the `first` element, the `last` element, and a non-zero `step`.
The first element is `first`, subsequent elements are the previous element plus a `step`.
The last element is always hit by iteration unless the progression is empty.
Iteration over a progression with a positive step is equivalent to an indexed `for` loop in Java/JavaScript.



```java
for (int i = first; i <= last; i += step) {
  // ……
}
```


When you create a progression implicitly by iterating a range, this progression's `first` and `last` elements are the range's endpoints, and the `step` is 1.



```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (i in 1..10) print(i)
//sampleEnd
}

```


To define a custom progression step, use the `step` function on a range.



```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (i in 1..8 step 2) print(i)
//sampleEnd
}

```


The last element of the progression is calculated to find the maximum value not greater than the end value for a positive step or the minimum value not less than the end value for a negative step such that `(last - first) % step == 0`.

To create a progression for iterating in reverse order, use `downTo` instead of `..` when defining the range for it.



```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    for (i in 4 downTo 1) print(i)
//sampleEnd
}

```


Progressions implement `Iterable<N>`, where `N` is `Int`, `Long`, or `Char` respectively, so you can use them in various [collection functions](collection-operations.html) like `map`, `filter`, and other.



```kotlin
fun main() {
//sampleStart
    println((1..10).filter { it % 2 == 0 })
//sampleEnd
}

```
